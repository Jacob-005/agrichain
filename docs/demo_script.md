## Act 4: Market Comparison & Pocket Cash (60 seconds)

13. **Tap "Compare Mandis"** → Map view with nearby mandis
14. **Results table:**

| Mandi          | Price/kg | Distance | Transport | Pocket Cash |
|----------------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 🏆 Wardha APMC | ₹15      | 12 km    | ₹600      | **₹11,400** |
| Nagpur APMC    | ₹18      | 5 km     | ₹300      | **₹14,100** |
| Nashik APMC    | ₹25      | 580 km   | ₹8,000    | **₹12,000** |
| Amravati APMC  | ₹22      | 155 km   | ₹3,500    | **₹14,100** |

15. **Pocket Cash Insight:** "💡 Nashik offers ₹25/kg (highest!) but after 
    transport costs, Nagpur gives you the same ₹14,100 in your pocket — 
    and it's only 5 km away!"
16. **Highlight:** The "Pocket Cash" column is emphasized — showing that 
    the highest ₹/kg isn't always the best deal.

> **Narration:** "This is the Pocket Cash concept. Nashik's price is ₹25/kg 
> — the highest — but after ₹8,000 in transport, Ramesh only pockets ₹12,000. 
> Nagpur at ₹18/kg is closer and puts ₹14,100 in his pocket. AgriChain makes 
> this instantly clear."
